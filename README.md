## Introduction
Buffer Overflow (BoF) is a common vulnerability found in software, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the buffer's boundaries, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution of malicious code. This repository serves as a resource to understand, practice, and prevent such vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started
To get started with the examples and code provided in this repository, ensure you have a basic understanding of programming languages (e.g., C/C++) and fundamental cybersecurity concepts.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C/C++
- Familiarity with Linux/Unix environments

## Usage
Explore the provided code examples and walkthroughs to understand how buffer overflows work and how to exploit or defend against them.

To compile and run the examples:
```bash
# Replace 'example.c' with the desired example file
gcc -o example example.c
./example
```

## Examples
- **SimpleBufferOverflow.c**: Demonstrates a basic buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **StackSmashingDefense.c**: Shows a preventive measure against stack smashing.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for any improvements, additional examples, or corrections.

## License
